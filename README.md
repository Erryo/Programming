# My Programming Projects

This repository contains all the projects and side projects I create. Its purpose is to make my code public so I do not lose it. Additionally, if someone encounters errors while using my code, they can report them through GitHub issues, allowing me to address and fix them. I also hope this repository will serve as my portfolio.
